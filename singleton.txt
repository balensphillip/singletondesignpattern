1. Ensure that a class has just a single instance.
    - Step 1.1.: Create the singleton class.
    - Step 1.2: Create a private and static instance variable
    - Step 1.3: Create and define a private constructor

2. Provide a global access point to that instance.
    - Step 2.1.: Create and define a public and static accessor(s) of the instance.
